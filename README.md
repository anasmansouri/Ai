# Machine learning project
## about : 

we have improved a system for recommending films. The goal of the system is to provide accurate movie recommendations to users. Typically, basic recommendation systems consider one of the following factors to generate recommendations:
* user preference (i.e. based on content filtering)
* the preference of similar users (collaborative filtering, for example). To build a stable and precise environment The recommendation system used in this project is based on element-based collaborative filtering (in this case movies).
